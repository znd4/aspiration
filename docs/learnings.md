# Learnings

This was a fun project. Here are some of the new tools I got a chance to explore.

## mkdocs

I'd used this a _bit_ before, but I got a chance to play around with a lot of plugins.

## hypothesis

Like `mkdocs`, I'd used `hypothesis` for a couple projects before, but I'd never used it as extensively as I have here (it's been really useful for catching edge cases).
